                <h2>Hello! Welcome to Therese's Recipes. The one stop shop for all things that I love to cook and bake.
                </h2>
                <p>I started cooking in college, like many young adults do, as it is a necessary skill to nourish
                    oneself
                    day to day. I've always had a desire to eat delicious food, which is something I picked up from my
                    parents. Together, we enjoy trying new restaurants in our hometown and wherever we travel, but
                    nothing
                    beats a home cooked meal. Growing up, it was my dad who made many of our indulgent meals with skills
                    he
                    picked up from watching his dad cook growing up, and the occasional YouTube tutorial. My mom is also
                    a
                    talented cook, creating meals that are yummy while also being rich in nutrients.</p>
                <p>My parents always told me, "If you want to eat good food, you have to make it yourself."</p>
                <p>My mother battled breast cancer while I was in undergrad. It was difficult and turbulent to say the
                    least. It also caused me to revaluate what I'm putting in my body. Is it good for me? Could it hurt
                    me?
                    Of course, everything is good in moderation, but I wanted to minimize health risks as much as I
                    could.
                </p>
                <p>So, I've spent A LOT of my early adulthood making food to enjoy. Many dishes sometimes felt more like
                    experiments, and my knowledge on food and nutrition has expanded through my own research. I've had
                    many
                    successes and many failures. Each failure provided much insight I used to improve.</p>
                <p>Now, I have a place to share everything I've learned. I hope you find something yummy here!</p>
