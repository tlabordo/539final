            <h2>Sourdough Bread</h2>
            <p>I started making sourdough bread in April 2024. I have tried many recipes and have created some ugly
                loaves.
                After a lot of trial and error (and a lot of scrolling on Sourdough TikTok) I have put together a recipe
                that works well for me. Maybe it will work well for you too!</p>

            <ul class="tools">
                <li>Metal or Ceramic bowl</li>
                <li>Whisk or fork</li>
                <li>Saran wrap or bowl covers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This recipe makes 1 loaf of bread. <br> Feel free to double it to make two loaves</p>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol class="instructions">
                <li>Mix water and starter in a large glass/ceramic bowl with a whisk or fork until the starter is
                    fully dissolved.</li>
                <li>Add in the bread flour to the bowl and mix with a spatula or your hands until a shaggy dough is
                    formed.
                    (You can add salt at this step, or wait until step 4)</li>
                <li>Cover the dough with saran wrap or a wet towel and let rest for 30mins-1hr</li>
                <li>After the first resting period, add salt before performing your first set of stretch and folds.</li>
                <li>Grab the dough at one side and pull it upwards, waving the dough back and forth on the way up before
                    pushing the elongated side down in the center. Turn the bowl 1/4 around and repeat. Do this twice
                    around.</li>
                <li>Repeat step 5 every 30 minutes until you complete 4 rounds of stretch and folds</li>
                <li>Cover the dough and let it rest on your counter for 4-10 hours for bulk fermentation depending on
                    the
                    temperature of your kitchen (1. To check of your dough is ready after bulk fermentation, you can do
                    a
                    poke test.)</li>
                <li>Dump your dough onto a lightly floured surface and spread your dough flat by pulling it into a
                    rectangle. Try to deflate any majorly large bubbles (unless you want a huge hole in your bread)</li>
                <li>Time to shape the dough! Fold in the right side towards the middle then fold in the left side over
                    the right side
                    (doesn’t
                    matter which side you actually start on) The loaf should be folded like a paper folded into
                    thirds
                    going
                    into an envelope</li>
                <li>Starting at the end closest to you, roll the folded dough into a ball. It might be shaped like a
                    really big sideways cinnamon roll.</li>
                <li>Create tension by pushing one side of the loaf away from you, then pull the dough towards you
                    with
                    both hands.</li>
                <li>Lightly flour a tea towel in a bowl and put your boule in the bowl seam side up.</li>
                <li>Cover with saran wrap and let it rest in your fridge for 1hr-48hrs.</li>
                <li>When you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450 with your dutch oven inside.</li>
                <li>While the oven is preheating, bring your boule out onto parchment paper or a bread sling. Create
                    your
                    expansion score with a knife as one slash down the middle or side. You can also do an X. If you want
                    to
                    create a fun design, dust the top with rice flour before scoring to make the design pop.</li>
                <li>Place your boule in your dutch oven and put it in the oven with the lid on for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>After the 25 minutes is completed, take the lid off your dutch oven and let your bread continue to
                    bake,
                    uncovered, for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Take your bread out of the oven. Your bread is ready when the internal temp is between 200-210</li>
                <li>Let the loaf rest on a wire rack for at least 1 hour. If you can wait at least 2 hours, or even
                    overnight, that is better. </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <div class="notes">
                <p>The bulk fermentation time begins when you add your salt in. The reaction the salt does is called
                    “autolyse.” I like to let my dough rest intially without salt because that has always worked best
                    for my
                    timing/scheduling. I also read somewhere it helps with gluten development.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of different techniques for shaping. I reccomend watching some Tiktoks or Youtube
                    videos
                    to get a better idea of what’s out there.</p>
                <p>I have never needed to add ice for steam with this recipe. Steam will also make any flour added on
                    top
                    for scoring designs dissolve.</p>
                <p>You can add in inclusions at the shaping stage. If you work with fruit , make sure it is frozen to
                    avoid
                    mixing in additional moisture content before baking. If you make a sugar paste of sorts, such as
                    cinnamon sugar, try to make your paste thick.</p>
